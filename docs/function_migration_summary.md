# Function Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of functions from the Jupyter notebook `3_learn_null_edge.ipynb` to dedicated helper modules in the `src/` directory.

## Migrated Functions

### src/sampling.py
**Purpose**: Representative sampling functions for edge prediction datasets

1. **`stratified_positive_sampling()`**
   - Performs stratified sampling of positive edges based on degree distributions
   - Preserves degree distribution characteristics while reducing sample size
   - Parameters: edges_matrix, degrees, n_samples, random_state

2. **`representative_negative_sampling()`**
   - Generates negative edges that match positive edge characteristics  
   - Multiple methods: degree_matched, distribution_matched, hybrid
   - Parameters: edges_matrix, degrees, positive_edges, n_samples, method, random_state

3. **`create_representative_dataset()`**
   - Complete pipeline for creating representative datasets
   - Combines positive and negative sampling with quality reporting
   - Parameters: edges_matrix, degrees, n_positive, n_negative, pos_method, neg_method, random_state

### src/experiments.py
**Purpose**: Experiment utilities for model performance analysis

1. **`calculate_prediction_stability()`**
   - Calculates coefficient of variation across cross-validation folds
   - Measures prediction stability/consistency
   - Parameters: y_true, predictions, metric

2. **`run_experiment()`**
   - Runs comprehensive experiments across different sample sizes
   - Tests multiple models with cross-validation
   - Parameters: create_dataset_func, sample_sizes, n_runs, cv_folds, models, random_state, verbose

3. **`analyze_experiment_results()`**
   - Analyzes experiment results and generates summary statistics
   - Provides recommendations and correlation analysis
   - Parameters: results_df, save_path, verbose

## Benefits of Migration

### âœ… Modularity
- Functions are now organized in logical modules
- Easier to understand code organization
- Clear separation of concerns

### âœ… Reusability
- Functions can be imported in other notebooks and scripts
- No need to copy/paste code between files
- Consistent function signatures and behavior

### âœ… Maintainability
- Changes only need to be made in one place
- Proper documentation and type hints
- Easier to test individual functions

### âœ… Cleaner Notebooks
- Notebooks focus on analysis rather than function definitions
- Reduced cell count and improved readability
- Faster notebook loading and execution

## Usage

### Import in Notebooks
```python
# Add src directory to path
import sys
from pathlib import Path
repo_dir = Path().absolute().parent
src_dir = repo_dir / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(src_dir))

# Import functions
from sampling import create_representative_dataset
from experiments import run_experiment
```

### Import in Scripts
```python
from src.sampling import create_representative_dataset
from src.experiments import run_experiment, analyze_experiment_results
```

## Files Modified

### Created
- `src/sampling.py` - Sampling functions with comprehensive documentation
- `src/experiments.py` - Experiment utilities with analysis capabilities

### Updated  
- `notebooks/3_learn_null_edge.ipynb` - Replaced function definitions with imports

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Full backward compatibility maintained**
- All function calls in the notebook work exactly as before
- Same function signatures and return values
- No changes needed to existing analysis code

## Testing

The migration has been tested by:
1. âœ… Importing all functions successfully
2. âœ… Running notebook cells that use the functions
3. âœ… Verifying function signatures match original implementations
4. âœ… Confirming all existing analysis continues to work

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for the new modules
2. **Documentation**: Consider adding more detailed API documentation
3. **Optimization**: Profile functions for potential performance improvements
4. **Extension**: Add new sampling methods or experiment configurations as needed
